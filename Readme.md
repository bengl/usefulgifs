# UsefulGifs.com

This is almost the simplest URL shortener imaginable, and it's manually curated, and written in CoffeeScript just for 
fun! The complete list of gifs is in routes.coffee, so go have a look! To add new gifs to the list: fork, edit, pull 
request.

#### Why would you do such a pointless thing with such an awesome domain?

I bought the domain on a whim, and thought "What could I do with this?", and here is the result. Besides, this is way 
better than some SEO parking BS (*What You Need, When You Need Itâ„¢*).

#### But I want a normal URL shortner!

There are hundreds of those here on github, and if you just want to use one, try http://goo.gl or http://bit.ly.

#### Why did you write it in CoffeeScript? and why Node.js?

Node.js is fricken awesome, and if you don't think so, well that's just too bad. Ditto for CoffeeScript.

#### Why isn't there a backend or anything?

Maybe on day there will be, but for now I think this is good enough. Until the list gets too huge.

#### You made a mistake in your code!

Really? That's awesome! I love mistakes, because then I get to learn from them! Either open an issue, or fix it 
yourself and pull request.

#### What's that Procfile for?
